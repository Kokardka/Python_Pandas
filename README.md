First something about my problems with connection to the Kernel 
through Anaconda Navigator --> Jupyter notebook.

This is a tip for other users with the same issue.

Try this:

It will help!

The rest of my adventure (on a working Jupyter:)) below...

But something about theory.

Pandas is a Python library that gives a fantastic set of tools to do data analysis.
The name comes from “panel data” - panda.

And why Python Pandas?
1. It is definately more comfortable than Excel;
2. It can be used to working with Big Data;
3. Pandas is a free software library written for the Python programming language
(so if someone know and like Python it is a great option);
4. Pandas allows importing data of various file formats, also excel.

I've also tried Visual Studio Code to learn Python Pandas.

Link to original source of data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon
(good open source Machine Learning website)

and as I said before, Pandas also allows importing data of various file formats like excel:

It is good to have dark theme if someone is working a lot, so Visual Studio Code is really nice.

Pandas also allows importing data like txt:

Plotting data (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt) - library to work with while plotting data in Python is matplotlib:

That was an experiment.

I am doing my own short database for other tests, but it will be in the next repository.
Here I will continue with those ones.
