But something about theory.

Pandas is a Python library that gives a fantastic set of tools to do data analysis.
The name comes from “panel data” - panda.

And why Python Pandas?
1. It is definately more comfortable than Excel;
2. It can be used to working with Big Data;
3. Pandas is a free software library written for the Python programming language
(so if someone know and like Python it is a great option);
4. Pandas allows importing data of various file formats, also excel.

I've also tried Visual Studio Code to learn Python Pandas.
